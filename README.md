# ToDoListApp
Basic Description:
Basic To do list app practice

This is an app that shows task that can be marked as completed and/or deleted by the user. 
In order to accomplish this I used various data structures. I made a struct for the tasks that have a string and a boolean. Then I made an array of all the tasks needed. The array is displayed on the screen, each task is put the in correct section according to an if statement that uses the boolean value in each task. When the box is clicked the boolean is toggled and the task is moved and striked. The user also has the ability to delete a task by swiping it to the left. In order to accomplish this app i used a for loop that went through the array in order to display all the tasks. I then also check if any cell is being swiped or needs to be deleted.
